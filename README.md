- [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions)

## Topics covered so far

- Arrays
- Hashing*
- Two pointers
- Sliding Window*
- Binary Search
- Linked List

## To-Do

- Trees
- Tries
- Graphs
- DP
- Greedy
- Specific algorithms (Djikstra's, different sorting algorithms, etc.)

## Notes

- Switched to Python to focus on algorithm rather than syntax
- When you see "substring" in a problem, consider `Sliding Window` technique
- When you see that a problem requires O(log*n) complexity, consider `Binary Search`
- Reversing a linked list (often used in larger problems) is about reversing pointers, not exchanging list values
- Taking midpoint of an array can be `(l + r) // 2` in Python, but should be `l + (r - l) / 2` in other languages to avoid [integer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow)
